Long, linear two-storey building, very close to the 'Avni Rustemi' roundabout, used as a mixed-used unit with services on its ground-floor and residential character on its upper floor, judging also by the several chimneys on the roof. The upper floor of this building is partially neglected and un-used. You can notice traces of a modern european architecture, italian rationalism, with the facade ornaments and red-brick walls.
