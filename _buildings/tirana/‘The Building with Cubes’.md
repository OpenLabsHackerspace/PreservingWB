Pallati me Kuba also known from locals as Kadare’s Palace (where illustrious families like the ones of D.Agolli and I.Kadare have been living for several years) and which in architectural professional circles is considered as one of the first iniciators of the ‘ modernist’ era in Tirana. Therefore it was labeled as an intentioned provocation to the official Communist art of the time. Also the building’s volumetri was perceived as with clear orientation towards ‘Kubism’ in a visible contrast with the gloomy socialist architecture preveling that periode. Today, eventhough it stands in one of the most visible spots of the city center, its condition provokes a state of compassion, an eyesore, where each sign of the time passing-by, is sufficiently visible from the lack of plaster in the  main facades to the illegal adjanted  spaces on the groundfloor etc. A structure that once provoked so much reaction, today stays completely ignored and neglected. Its architect is Maks Velo
