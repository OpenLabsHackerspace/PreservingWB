The construction for the National stadium 'Qemal Stafa' finished in 1946, implementing a similar scheme with that of small city stadiums in Italy . The project for the stadium was realized by a team, lead by the Italian architect, Gherardo Bosio, conceived as part of a very important architectural Ensamble for Tirana, including the today University of Tirana building (former 'Casa del Fascio'), The Colonnade and Academy of Arts. Fact that is shown in the treatment of the main facades with big decorative marble tiles, in the same way the University building facade is, giving to it a sense of belonging to the site and connecting very harmoniously with the sorrounding. A secondary square, Square 'Italia', was created beside the main square 'Mother Theresa', so that the big number of people and fans waiting for the football match to start, would have a foyer where to wait. An important Olympic running track was part of the inner stadium also. In the 1970s, the government decided to increase the capacity of the stadium and so the stairs were built with a system of reinforced concrete trusses. Through the years the outdoor facade spaces of the stadium were occupied from informal coffe shops, shops and other  businesses. The stadium was demolished in 2016 to be replaced with a new one, through changing his status of a monument of second category.
