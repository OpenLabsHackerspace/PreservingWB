The 'Partizani' cinema was built in 1956 and was the largest cinema in Tirana with a capacity of 780 people. The project was realized by arch. Koco Miho and was siuated along the 'Barrikada' Street, in front of the 'Partizani i panjohur' monument, where the cinema took its name. It consisted of a platea and a balcony, also a special element of its kind was the creation of a space in the continuation of the entrance hall, as a concert hall with smaller capacities for people who came earlier to the cinema, but did not find application in other cinemas built in Tirana. Simple volumetric, compact, symmetrical composition, to give a little life to the facades, cracks are realized in the side facades that did not match the function of the construction typology. In front of it was built a residential building with space on the ground floor, through which the entrance of the cinema could be seen only.
