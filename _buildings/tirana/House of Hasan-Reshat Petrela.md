It represents a vernacular, Tirana city house, located on Street 'Barrikada'. It is a first Category monument, listed as such in 1980. The building has a rectangular layout plan and has two floors, not representing the 'fire-house' typology, around which all the main functions were developed, and which is typical of this area in Albania. The first floor functioned as a so-called 'ahur' in the Albanian traditional architecture where the households and food were stored. The second floor, which was the main living space, is higher and contains decorative elements, both woodwork on the ceilings and decorative window frames. As a result of the changes in the 1930s the house has lost its original appearance. The changes can be noticed in the windows, which have been enlarged, and the creation of a balcony with iron railing in the middle of the facade. The house has two entrances, on completely opposite facades, as it served for two families and apparently one half of the house, the one not visible from the street, stands today uninhabited, neglected and endangered.
