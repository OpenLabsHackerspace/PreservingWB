This villa is thought to have been built around 1942. It is also thought to have been commissioned by an Italian who later died. The land is owned by the 'Begeja' family (one of the most known old families of the city), and the house has 10 owners nowadays. It is also believed that during the years of communism it served as a place of torture.
