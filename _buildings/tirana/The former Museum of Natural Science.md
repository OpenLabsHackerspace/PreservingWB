The Museum of Natural science, a building that doesn't exist anymore, had different functions during the years of its existence. It was built by investors and owners from some of the most important families of the city like Preza, Fortuzi, Llagami. During the regime of King Zogu it used to be a Dormitory, Dormitory ‘Naim Frasheri’. It used to be organized in three floors, but the last one was removed because of its later function, serving for the aviation. During the fascist Italian regime, it served as an airplane’s motors repairing unit. In 948 the building worked as ‘The Museum of Natural Science’ related to the Science Institute (state property). In 2009 four private owners of the site where the building stood, appeared and through a court’s decision, the building became their property. There were several polemics regarding the fact if the Museum should move or not from its original location, there were some students protest also but neither of those worked to change its final fate. The Museum was demolished and transformed into a construction site for a high-rise complex of businesses and housing.
