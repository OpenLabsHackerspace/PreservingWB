This villa is part of an area in Tirana, designed as the so called Garden City back then, where a very important urban unit of the city where houses distanced from the streets  with a prominent rich, garden. The villa has a clear tendency towards italian  rationalist architecture based on the project of architect 'Brasini', but also with some influences from Bauhaus school. At the front of the villa, with access to the main road, there is the main entrance to the house, while on the other side there is the gate passing to the backyard, where a second entrance is visible.
