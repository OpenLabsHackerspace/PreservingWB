This house is a monument of the first category, declared in 1973. It functioned as the headquarters of the 'Bashkimi' Organization. It was realized as a private building in one of the artery alleys around the square 'Avni Rustemi'. The complex consisted of two buildings, where their planimetric and volumetric concept is almost the same and are realized next to each other. The first rises above ground level without a basement and has a shallow foundation approximately 50 cm filled with river stones. The second is almost like the first maintaining the same technique and with the same building materials as adobe, planks, pieces of brick to fill the walls, wooden frame and lime plastering. Today, only the facade of one of them is clearly legible, where as a result of the chaotic urban development of the alley, it seems to be embedded between buildings and totally unrestored over the years.
