This building situated in a very busy overbuilt neighborhood, surrounded by high-rise residential buildings, has many co-owners, who nowadays do not live in the city anymore. The ground floor has assumed the function of a coffee bar. Also, one of the rooms is used by one person. The upper floors are deserted, uninhabited. The functional partition of the building was one apartment per floor. One of the facades has been completely changed from its original aesthetic and treatment from which, a rational, modernist architecture can be noticed.
