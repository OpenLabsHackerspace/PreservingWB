This is a two-storey house. Its original owner, is believed to have been the cook of King Ahmet Zogu. Since it stands very close, along a very narrow one-way street, you can notice some changes done through the years to close it as much possible, to the street. Its ground-floor was completly closed by a continuous wall and the first floor where you can spot all of its windows blocked by another inner wall.
