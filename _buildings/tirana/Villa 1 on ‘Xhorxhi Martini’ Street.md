Monument of first category, listed in 1973. It has served as the headquarters of the Organization 'Bashkimi', even though It was realized as a private residential building. It used to be a complex consisting of two buildings, with almost the same plan and volume concept, also the two buildings used to be close to each other, today there is only one of them. The first house rises above ground level without a basement and has a low foundation of approximately 50 cm, filled with river-stones. The second one almost like the first one and it preserves the same building techniques, with the first building materials like adobe bricks, wooden planks, bricks, wood carving, and lime-plastering.
