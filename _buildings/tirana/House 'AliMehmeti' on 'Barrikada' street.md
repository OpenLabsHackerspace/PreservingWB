It is Believed to have been built around 1938, with an Italian project. Its original function was residential, then during the years of the communist regime it returned to the first kindergarden of the city of Tirana, then served as the 'Institute of Alternative Medicine'. This situation continued until the 1990s when it returned to its original owners. A very similar project is located on the other side of the street, just inside the neighborhood, which is nowadays used as an actual kindergarden.
