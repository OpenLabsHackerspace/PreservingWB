The villa in question is located behind the Albanian Post Office, somewhere drawn from 'Reshit Collaku' street creating the space of a small courtyard in front of it. This villa is believed to have been built in 1930, has a considerable extension and development both in horizontal and vertical, developed in three storeys. It has a symmetrical composition that is very visible, in its main volume and facade. The central unit of the villa has been treated in the form of a balustrade lodge and a perimeter column system. Some deforming interventions into the facade of the villa are evident, showing attempts to close even more the lodges with brick masonry, or through windows-blockings. No intervention was made for its restoration, as large plaster fragments and pieces have been detached from the original facade. Also the floor space was fragmented through the years, through a main division on the ground floor with a massive wall.
