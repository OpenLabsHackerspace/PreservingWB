This villa was co-owned by several families, by the grandsons of the original owner who commissioned and built it, today has changed ownership to a single owner. The house, despite the preservation of many characteristic architectural elements on on its exterior, its interior is almost totally ruined and inaccessible on the upper floor becouse of the unstable staircase. Its backyard is thought to be inhabited by people who have occupied it temporarily.
