The project was realized by Florestano Di Fausto from 1928 and constructed in 1931. It is considered to be one of the most well-achieved project implementations, compared to the other buildings of the administrative complex, designed by him. It had a very important urban position in the north part of the Scanderbeg square, along also two main streets, 'Boulevard Zog' and 'Nana Mbretnesh'. It was the seventh building to be realized after the construction of the other Ministries. The building was planned to be demolished after 8 years, of the construction work, as part of the General Regulation plan of Bosio of 1939, but in reality, it was demolished after 40 years in the 80', during the Communist regime, to make space for the construction of the National Museum of History.
