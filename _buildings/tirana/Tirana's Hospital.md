'Tirana's Hospital' which was later renamed 'The State Hospital' used to be located at the site of 'Hani i Esat Pashes', next to the Clock Tower. Dr. Osman Jonuzi, who was at the same time the chief of Surgerys Department, was assigned as the director of the hospital. In 1920 the American Red Cross asked the Albanian state to maintain the hospital at its own expense. This building was one of the oldest in Tirana and when the new hospital was built in 1932, it changed function and was transformed into a hotel. in 1948 it was burnt down by the 'State Security'(Sigurimi) and later was completely demolished. In this location, today there is a plan for the realization of a three-tower building complex, exactly between the Clock Tower and the building of the 'Kaceli' family.
