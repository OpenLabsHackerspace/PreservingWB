The main façade of the Villa  is oriented to the south  with  main access to Rruga e Durresit. The villa was built in 1931 by its owner 'Qemal Jusufati' and served after as the ‘Turkish Legata’(Legata was called an Embassy around  the 20s, 30s) and afterwards, after 1945 served as The Embassy of Yugoslavia. The building is  organized into two storeys and another third volume serving as a roof. It has four entrances, two on the southern façade and two on the northern one on its back. It is characterized with openings in the shape of pointed arches ‘a sesto acuto’ that place all their weight on the columns an both sides, that reminds of a certain venetian architecture. The building today stands neglected, for a very long time now.
