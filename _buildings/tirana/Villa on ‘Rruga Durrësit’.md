This urban villa represents a monument of the second category, listed in March 2007. It was built around the beginning of the '30s and later functioned as the seat of the Turkish Embassy, at that time it was called 'Turkish Legata', despite being realized with a residential character in mind. Its architecture resembles neoclassical features rich in detailed window frames and floral ornaments, along the main facades as well as railings with treated iron profiles. There are two visible entrances along the main street façade as well as a secondary one from behind the house. Regarding the construction, it is made of brick masonry, mortar and wood. It is one of the most monumental and spacious villas if we refer to its horizontal extentention. The villa's  volume stands out especially along the main street, from the combination of the rich architecture of facades with the natural elements, more specifically hanging ivy and greenery.
