The Pristina Monography by Sanije Gashi says that the house belonged to Mile Lazic, who had previously bought it from a priest. On the ground floor was the bakery run by Abdurrahim Furrunxhi, known in the city as the 'bakery with pictures'. Based on the inscription on the crown of the building, the house was built in 1925. It is a two-storey house, with openings on both floors. The ground floor part is seen to have subsequent interventions as the building today presents large openings (front store), with new materials. The front fa√ßade on the first floor presents numerous decorations over the windows and roof borders, details with a mixture of neo-classical and baroque motifs. On the roof, on the same axis as the balcony, there is a crown shape attic wall on either side of which stand two sculptures with their hands pointed at each other. From the loss of the cladding material it is clear that the building is built of baked bricks, material typical for the time of construction (inscription of the year). Today the building is abandoned and shows considerable damage especially in the loss of cladding material and exposure of constructive material.
