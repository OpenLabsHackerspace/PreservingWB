The administrative building of ElektroKosova is the result of an architectural competition organized in 1977, where the first prize was won by the architect Dragan Kovacevic with the bureau 'Invest Bureau'. It was inaugurated in 1984. In the city the building is also known by the nickname Lepa Brena, which means 'beautiful pine', a name given to it by the citizens to symbolize its length and beauty. The administration is located in the vertical volume and has a special entrance, separated from the communication with clients. The customer area is located at the foot of the building, divided into two floors with a separate entrance from the administrative part. Due to the sloping terrain, customer entrances are accessed by stairs. The building is lined with marble and stained glass. Due to the administrative function, the building has many openings on all sides of the façade. In the southern part of the building, after 2000, there were inadequate interventions covering the original façade partly with a ventilated façade with alucobond.
