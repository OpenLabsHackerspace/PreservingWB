The House of the 'Hyjniler' family, belongs to the type of city-houses built during the end of the XVIII century and the beginning of the XX. The central part of the house is the interconnecting space known as 'divanhanja' which is accessible from the ground floor through a semi-circular wooden staircase. The 'divanhane' is organized in the visible corner section of the main fa√ßade. From the interconnecting space, you enter through all the other rectangular-shaped rooms. The building is organized on two floors, ground floor and the first one defined by adobe brick walls and wooden construction. The main part of the facade on the horizontal line features wooden windows, which give abundant illumination to all its interior spaces. The four-sloped roof is covered with traditional rounded tiles. The rooms are rich in ceilings decorations, cupboards, and 'hamamxhike' with wooden decorations. This house represents a special kind of Balkan civic architecture.
