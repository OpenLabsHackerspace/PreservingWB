The house listed under the name Shefqet Mehmeti is located on Meto Bajraktari Street, near the old building of the Municipality of Pristina. According to some sources, the building dates from the 20th century, but from the visible construction due to the loss of the facade, it clearly appears to be made of earthen brick (adobe) masonry and wooden skeletal construction, a construction characteristic of the houses of the 18th and 19th century. It is a two-storey house, with pure symmetry reflected in the same number of openings on both floors. Above the entrance door is what can be considered a qoshk, raised on four pillars, open and uncovered. From the loss of materials it can be seen that the existing facade is added over time because it shows new materials, which do not coincide with the construction type. Today the building shows neo-classical decorations on the window frames, corners of the building and the qoshk. The building is abandoned while the yard is used as a private parking space. The level of detachments and material losses is very high. The western wall of the building is completely open losing the filler material (adobe bricks) and exposing the skeleton construction from wood to atmospheric conditions.
