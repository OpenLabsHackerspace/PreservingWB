Inside the 'Boro Ramizi' Complex is the famous confectionery 'Elida', which was not just a confectionery and cafe, but represented an important informal meeting point for the elite of the time, artists, politicians, activists, around the late 80s to early 90s. It represented a common space where important discussions, event programs and many initiatives for society were taking place. It is believed that the famous artist Bekim Fehmiu, before leaving Pristina in '87, met with his friends and artists there. Also, the members of the LDK party, chose exactly Elida as a meeting place to declare 'Ibrahim Rugova' as their leader. Elida is still functional today and has preserved interior elements (such as the ceiling, seats and floor) since the time of opening.
