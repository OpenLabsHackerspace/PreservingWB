Musli Hoxha residential house is located in Luan Haradinaj Street, near the Family Health Center of the city. From as little as can be seen outside the defenses, it can be seen that the building has a longitudinal plan, with the main fa√ßade (narrowest part) oriented from the street. From the old photos of the building it can be seen that it was two-storey, with the first floor protruding above the ground floor one and supported by a diagonal beams, with a two-sided roof covered with traditional tiles. According to some sources, the building dates back to 1927, but from the visible construction due to the loss of the facade, it clearly appears to be made of earthen brick (adobe) masonry and wooden skeletal construction, a construction characteristic of the houses of the18th and 19th century. On the north side of the building, once stood a twentieth century building. Due to the discovery of the facade, it can be seen that in its longevity there have been interventions because today we can observe the presence of baked bricks instead of those of adobe and other materials that do not match the authentic building materials.Today this building is surrounded by physical fences on all four sides because of its risks of collapsing any day now. It has been left in this very deteriorated state and close to collapse for a while, while its yard is used as a parking lot.
