It is a vernacular house built in the second half of the 19th century. It is located in the old historical center of Pristina, near the old bazaar. From old photos of Pristina it can be seen that the whole row and neighborhood near this building wascomprised of houses of this type. Although there is very little left of the existing structure to read the architecture of the building, from old photos which we have found it appears that the house was two storeys high, with openings on both floors. On the second floor there was a closed qoshk with windows on all three sides of it. As can be seen from the remains, this monument, like most of the buildings of this period, was built of massive brick walls on the ground floor with seismic rib of wooden beams and a wooden skeleton construction with adobe fillings on the upper floors. This hypothesis can be supported by the fact that today we can only find remains of the ground floor because the first floor made of skeletal wooden structure was burned very easily, obliterating the remains of the building. In June 2013 it burned down for unknown reasons. During this period there were many 'accidental' fires of historical monuments, especially those at strategic points of the city. Hotel Unioni had the same fate. These fires have never been investigated.
