The building is registered as a monument under the name of Fitim Gjata. It was built in the second half of the 20th century. From remaining of the building one can understand that the building has a longitudinal stretch, with narrow faces from the street, in the row of shops of the old bazaar. According to the remains of the monument, it is clear that the building was built of baked bricks, typical of the time of construction, and had a two-story wooden roof. The facade from the street has a more detailed treatment, with a semicircular crown, with neoclassical decorations. Based on the latest monograph of Pristina (Gashi S.), this building is known as the house of Sava, of Savo Furrunxhi. The house next to it belonged to the Sava brothers. It is said to have been the former office of the Serbian Consulate that opened in 1887.Based on conversations with some citizens of the neighborhood, this space temporarily served as a Russian consulate, then Serbian and Austro-Hungarian.
