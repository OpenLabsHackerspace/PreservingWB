Kiosk K67 was introduced in 1966 by Slovenian architect and designer Saša J. Mächtig. After being patented in 1967, the K67 was prepared for serial production in 1968. The kiosks were a modular structure made of polyfibers, which functioned as a single unit or combined into larger ensembles. This modular design allows them to adapt to almost any location and context, as well as accommodate a variety of functions such as newspaper kiosks, parking toll booths, copy shops, market stalls, mobile cafes or lottery kiosks. K67 kiosks became very popular not only throughout the former Yugoslavia but they were also sold in Japan and New Zealand. They were easily detectable in cities because of colors like white, red, green and orange. K67 was part of the exhibition 'Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980', at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. K67 as an urban furniture were part of the collective memory of the city together with numerous memories such as buying family's daily newspaper or snacks on the way to school and more. Today such kiosks can rarely be found in Pristina (there are also in other parts of Kosovo) as their production has stopped. They are found spontaneously, sometimes abandoned or occasionally used, mostly as payment stands in parking lots.
