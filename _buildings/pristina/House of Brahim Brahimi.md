The house listed under the name Brahim Brahimi is located on Meto Bajraktari Street, near the old building of the Municipality of Pristina. It dates from the 19th century and belongs to the type of vernacular houses with open qoshk. It is a two-storey house with a typical volume of the typology it belongs. The ground floor has fewer openings and the upper floor is visually accessible with many windows and open corners. The qoshk rises from the ground floor to four pillars, independent of the structure of the building. The open part of the qoshk also presents a series of decorated pillars and a rosette-shaped ceiling, also decorated with wood. This characteristic space has been utilized as common space, especially during the hot seasons. The size of the house, the number of openings and the decorations indicate a high economic and social level of the owner for whom this house was built.Visual observations show that during its existence, the building has undergone many alternations of materials and architectural elements. It is clear that the roof has lost its characteristic semicircular tile covering and has been replaced with an incompatible covering. Today it is closed and abandoned and the building shows considerable deterioration with loss of material and decoration, distinctive for this typology.
