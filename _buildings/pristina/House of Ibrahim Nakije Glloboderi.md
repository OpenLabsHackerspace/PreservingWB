Ibrahim Glloboderi's house is located on Meto Bajraktari Street, near the building of the Municipality of Pristina, built around 1800. Nowadays the house serves as an international restaurant. Unfortunately the spaces inside have undergone many changes compared to the authentic version in order to accommodate the new function of the restaurant. Moreover, the facade and interior spaces have been painted in white and blue to create the Greek theme of the restaurant. Some of the authentic interior elements such as niches and upper shelves for storing dishes are still present.
