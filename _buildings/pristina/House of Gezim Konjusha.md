The residential house in the name of GÃ«zim Konjusha is located in front of the buil2ding of IKMM - Kosovo Institute for the Protection of Monuments and Elena Gjika school. According to sources it dates from the 19th century.The building is closed, abandoned and covered with thorns. Not much can be understood from the outside about the architecture or physical condition of this building because it is surrounded on all sides by high-rise, newly built dwellings. Also the east side, along the entire perimeter of the ground floor is covered with shops.The few elements that can be observed is the presence of a volume coming out in the southern part, which seems to be a closed qoshk type. The building appears to be in moderately good condition, with damage and loss of material to the roof shelter.
