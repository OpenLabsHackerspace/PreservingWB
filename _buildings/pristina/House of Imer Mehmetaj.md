The house which is located under the name of Imer Mehmetaj is located in Ismail Dumoshi street near the house of the family of the Gods. The building has elements very similar to the house of Kurtesh Sulejmani built in the XIX century, so it is likely that this building dates from the same time. Such a theory is also supported by the bondruk construction system consisting of a skeletal wooden structure filled with adobe bricks, which can be clearly seen from the discovery of the fa√ßade. It is a two-storey building, with the first floor protruding above the ground floor. The ground floor is visually impermeable due to only a minimal opening while the first floor has wide windows on the street facade. In its current state, the monument is abandoned and severely deteriorated. During visual observation, the house appears in a severely damaged condition with loss of architectural elements, loss of cladding material and discovery of construction, which due to atmospheric exposure may result in loss of structural integrity. Also, the building is surrounded by new megalomaniac dwellings, choked and sunk, disrespecting the perimeter of the monument.
