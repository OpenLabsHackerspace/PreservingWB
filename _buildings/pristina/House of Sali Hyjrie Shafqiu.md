The house listed under the name of Sali (Hyrie) Shafqiu was built in the 19th century and is located on Mehmet Ka√ßurri Street, in the historic core near the Mosque of Jashar Pasha and the Museum of Kosovo and near other houses of the same period as that of Kurtesh Sulejmani and Muharrem Sejdiu. The building is abandoned. Not much can be understood from the outside about the architecture or physical condition of this building because it is surrounded on all sides by high brick walls, part of the ensemble of the house. Due to the revelation of the structure from the loss of the facade, it can be seen that the house, like the houses of the same time, has a bondruk construction system consisting of a wooden frame structure with adobe brick filling. It is a two-storey building, with a pair of covered stairs, outside the volume of the house on the east wall, which ascend to the first floor.",
