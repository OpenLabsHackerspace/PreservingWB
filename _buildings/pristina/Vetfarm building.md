Vetfarm is a listed monument located behind the District Court, close to the green market. The book Abandoned Sites of Kosovo states that this building was built in 1931 and designed by Austrian architect Andrija Kremer, to serve the Women's Social Organization. Moreover, it is said that in 1932 it was used as a carpet craft school, to be transformed into the Hospital Hygiene Department after the Second World War. The building lies north - south in the shape of the letter L, with functions distributed on one floor, raised from the ground by 4 steps. The entrance of the building is marked with a volume extrusion out of the building, with a characteristic cover, a dome awning and semicircular staircase. From the revelation of the facade, the construction material made of baked brick can be observed, a material which is also seen in the buildings of the same time of construction. On the south facade, the building has 6 semicircular windows. Above the windows, as part of the decorations on the facade, one can notice a rhythm with relief in the shape of an arcade and neo-classical elements, characteristic of the style and architectural expression of the building. The building is abandoned and has major damage such as loss of roofing material and roof exposure, loss of construction and facade material as well as loss of architectural elements and decor.
