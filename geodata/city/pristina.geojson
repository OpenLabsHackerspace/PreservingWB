        "description": "This villa represents a traditional typology of the Albanian houses based on its organization,‘banese me qoshk’. Massive walls made of a traditional technique with mud ‘qerpici’, 40cm  thickness. There’s a simetric division of the main inner spaces and as a result it’s thought to have been used, through the years by two brothers. Today this house, doesn’t exist anymore even though represented one of the oldest typology of houses from Tirana and in its place there’s a high-rise building construction project going on.",
