        "name": "Media-house Building 'Rilindja'",
        "description": "The former Media-house 'Rilindja', located in the city center, on 'Luan Haradinaj' street, was realized by a group of engineers and architects, led by the well-known Macedonian architect Georgi Kostantinovski (a student of the American architect Paul Rudolph, in Yale University and intern at the IM Pei studio). It was designed in 1971, since the 70s were important and very productive years for the city's architecture and Urbanistic development, as part of Socialist Yugoslavia, after Kosovo's political autonomy in 1963. Its construction began in 1972 and because of some financial and political problems, ended only in 1978. It represents one of the most unique buildings of the region in the category of Brutalist architecture influenced by the American brutalist architecture of masters like Paul Rudolf and his building design in Boston, as the main architect says about his source of inspiration for it. The building is made out of two volumes, an 18-floor tower of 17 340m2 and 'The printing Hall' made out of two floors with a total of 28 345m2 surface and a typical industrial volume. This unit is made out of a space defined by 1mx1m wide columns, repeated each 10m distance.The building contains both architecture and historical value since first of all the facade of the tower is very rich in detail and the way it is treated technically, where all the utility tubes infrastructure pass through the inner space of the triangles on its facade, making it both aesthetic and functional. This was quite an innovative solution at the time. Also, the brutalist aesthetic of the facade elements is made out of color in white concrete. Also, the building has historical value because it was intentionally build to host the first written Albanian media during Socialist Yugoslavia, therefore was considered a 'nest' of intellectuals of the time. In November 2008 the 'Rilindja' organization stopped its activity and this was the period also where the building's architecture started to be altered, like interventions on the tower facade with the cladding, covering the honesty and simplicity of the white concrete structural elements and decorative elements, and somehow losing a part of history. After 2008 it was home to the 'Ministry of Public Services' and the 'Printing Hall', has been abandoned for long and used through the years informally, hosting restaurants, radio and TV stations, gyms, etc and partially abandoned but still remains with characteristics closer to its original state.",

        "name": "Grand Hotel Pristina",
        "description": "Grand Hotel Pristina was designed in 1974 by the Kosovar architect Bashkim Fehmiu and the Serbian architect Dragan Kovacevic and Misa Jevremovic, as a mid-size town hotel representative of late modernism architecture in Pristina, more aiming for an international style than actually trying to adapt to the surrounding architecture. It is situated in the city center being a very important part of the general urban plan of 1953 for Pristina, by Dragutin Petrovic and serving as an entrance gate to the main square 'Zahir Pajaziti', a very well-studied position since Fehmiu had an urban planning background also. The way it is situated, somehow breaking the linearity and continuity of the north-south Boulevard, creates valuable, positive public space around it. The building represents a landmark in the modernist architecture of Pristina, also because also of its characteristic volumetry, made simply with clean volumes, transmitting a certain sense of rhythm and calming repetition, by the way, placed in relation to each other. Several interventions started in 2012, and in the last two decades, many were implemented on its interior. Recently a project of facade-restoration started to be realized, but stopped because of several protests from Pristina's citizens and architects union, on the way this intervention was being applied. It was therefore transformed through the years, making it very difficult to be preserved as a Cultural modernist Monument.",
