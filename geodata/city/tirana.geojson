Massive walls made of a traditional technique with mud ‘qerpici’, 40cm  thickness. There’s a simetric division of the main inner spaces and as a result it’s thought to have been used, through the years by two brothers. Today this house, doesn’t exist anymore even though represented one of the oldest typology of houses from Tirana and in its place there’s a high-rise building construction project going on.",

        "description": "Villa ‘Fortuzi’ was built from Omer Fortuzi, it is believed around 1920. He used to be one of the first Albanian engineers and a member of one of the biggest and most important families in the city. Being once the mayor of Tirana( from 1940-1943), while he had this position he always tried to implement as many Italian projects as he could. The architecture of this villa is a confirmation of this intent too. It represents a very unique villa typology, with a very different architecture, compared to what was usually realized at the time, three-storey house designed with organic curves in all of its floors and very visible in its overall characteristic volumetry. It has an 'L' shape ground-floor blueprint, with two different entrances both accessing on abundant gardens. The main entrance door is very monumental with symmetric organic volumes. The organic lines follow also the way the terrace's metallic handrailing was designed and implemented. Its focal point is the entrance that representing the main symmetry ax of the building, is composed of three, 2 storey high, rectangular columns. The ground floor facade, the three entrance columns and the surrounding walls are covered with red brick tiles an element that links the entire composition of this villa. During communism, it is believed the original owners were expropriated and recently it hosted the offices of the Social-democratic party of Albania",

It was realized as a private building in one of the artery alleys around the square 'Avni Rustemi'. The complex consisted of two buildings, where their planimetric and volumetric concept is almost the same and are realized next to each other. The first rises above ground level without a basement and has a shallow foundation approximately 50 cm filled with river stones. The second is almost like the first maintaining the same technique and with the same building materials as adobe, planks, pieces of brick to fill the walls, wooden frame and lime plastering. Today, only the facade of one of them is clearly legible, where as a result of the chaotic urban development of the alley, it seems to be embedded between buildings and totally unrestored over the years.",

        "description": "The first Cinema in Tirana, also known as Cinema-Theater ‘Nacional’ realized in 1924. In 1939 this cinema-theater burned down and Jusuf Beshiri one of the owners contracted the architect Skender Luarasi to re-construct it. In 1940 it was re-opened under the new name 'Rex' and in 1943 regained again the same name. It represented a very important cultural center at the time and gathering place for the cities inhabitants. In 1945 took the name ’17 nëntori’ (the date of Tirana’s Independence). It was used as a cinema until 1991 (during which its ownership changed from the ‘Beshiret’ family to the Government). It was dominated by three high arches that sustained the projection cabin. The entrance was resolved with a certain simplicity and showed the professional skills of the author. The main hall was small and the black marble coverings had a certain calming effect. From there, you could walk in the ‘platea’ auditorium or go upstairs to the ‘loggias’ . The main cinema hall was well proportioned and with optimal auditive and visual parameters. On the right side were the doors to the exit. There was also a summer cinema that was very well connected with that winter cinema hall. It was the most luxurious Cinema in the capital during the king's regime and during the occupation also. Later on, some popular courts were held in its inner space and after that, it was used for spiritual sessions etc, until it decayed completely and it was given to its original owners back again, but it never returned back to being a cinema again. Finally, in 2003, the decision to completely demolish it, was taken and instead of it, a 'Shopping mall' was erected. In the beginning, it was said to save and re-use the existing façade of the building but afterward, this idea wasn’t implemented. Everything from the old Cinema vanished as it apparently never existed, the only thing remaining the same was its name.",

Therefore it was labeled as an intentioned provocation to the official Communist art of the time. Also the building’s volumetri was perceived as with clear orientation towards ‘Kubism’ in a visible contrast with the gloomy socialist architecture preveling that periode. Today, eventhough it stands in one of the most visible spots of the city center, its condition provokes a state of compassion, an eyesore, where each sign of the time passing-by, is sufficiently visible from the lack of plaster in the  main facades to the illegal adjanted  spaces on the groundfloor etc. A structure that once provoked so much reaction, today stays completely ignored and neglected. Its architect is Maks Velo",

This house stands along 'Qemal Stafa' street, from which it is distanced by an 18 m yard. This is not its whole original yard. five meters away from the villa, there's a five-floor silicate-brick residential building (built during socialism), which occupies part of its outdoor space. The villa is a mix of traditional architectural features like space organization rationality, the use of decorative wooden elements in the ceilings, or the emphasis of an element, like 'erker', in volumetry similar to many korcar houses. Also the use of neo-classic, European-influenced balcony and facade ornaments. It is organized in two floors where the ground floor has a lower height and during the years has suffered many changes, to meet the different, many inhabitants requests, like for example the creation of a secondary lateral door, or the placement of a ramp for people with physical impairments, along the main entrance. The pavement of this floor is treated with small decorative tiles, with motifs, while the ceiling of each space is covered in painted, decorative wood. On both floors, the main hall plays an important role in bringing together all the main spaces. On the first floor, it can be accessed by the monumental external staircase, which is so important for the whole volumetry of this villa. The first floor is developed with a considerate height, more lighting, a feature similar to many traditional houses where more importance is placed on the upper floor as the main living area. Its floor is all paved with wood, while the ceiling is the same as on the ground floor. The rooms are spacious and each has access to a bathroom and built-in closet. The presence of a laundry room and of a balcony, in the southern part of the villa is a sign that the owners were part of a high socio-economic rank. The whole facade of the villa is covered by decorative elements, with floral motifs. The family lived there, during 1944-1945, after this period it was confiscated by the state, to be taken back after, by its original owner's sons, after the fall of Communism. The lack of consensus among its owners and the lack of interest from the responsible, appropriate structures, in giving it protected status, has brought its alarming, degraded state of nowadays.",

The company provided fast realization at a lower price because of the use of prefabricated elements from Milan. It was meant to be a sort of Cultural Center, with a sportive character also with a swimming pool, theater, offices, restaurant and serving as a social meeting point for the citizens. In terms of the volumetric composition, it is organized with two main ‘factory’ type of volumes, symmetric with each other through the main ax and connected through a ‘portico’. Its aesthetic brings to mind a post-futuristic style like the one of Angiolo Mazzonit. The materials used are concrete, wood and some prefabricated panels called 'populit' or ‘patercimento’. The constructive system is made of reinforced concrete very light 12x15cm height 8.5m, high enough to sustain a wooden truss as the roof structure. After the fascist regime, around 1941 it was known as 'Savoja' cinema and, it was re-named as 'Kosova' cinema in 1943 and after 1945 it was known as 'The Popular Theater' also because of the fact that the first trial against the 'state's enemy' was held in there. After 1991 started to be called 'The National Theater', the name that still holds strong today despite all the adversities. On the site of the National Theater which represents a public domain space, through a Public-Private agreement, it's intended to demolish the existing Theater and realize a new one together with several high-rises, mixed-use buildings, a project from the Danish architecture firm BIG. Currently a very contested decision from specialists of the field and the local community.",

This project was realized in 1935 but the construction works lasted until 1936, from the Italian engenieer Giulio Berte (whome is a very important name in the history of the architecture of Tirana, the one who realized The Palace of Brigades, once ‘The Royal Villa’ and  the design of the Scanderbeg Square in Tirana). This villa was commissioned by the once mayor of the Municipality of Tirana, Abedin Nepravishta ( Mayor from 1934-1936, and 1937-1939). This project was thought to have influenced King Zogu to ask Berte to realize also the project for his residence villa, ‘Royal Villa’ very notable today because of some similirities in terms of their design. Like many other Italian architects of that time G.Berte also intended a rational style with a representative character not realated to the existing architecture of the surrounding but  providing a certain combination of modernity and identity of the context also respecting specific urban conditions towards the main streets. Being a villa situated  in a crossroad of two very important mobility axes, it’s volumetry as a result was very defined and geometric, at the same time monumental providing a view towards the ‘Mussolini’ Boulevard, ‘Ethem Bej Mosque’ and further on to the main ‘Scanderbeg Square’. It has a very clear plan organizations, with an underground plan, ground floor plan, first floor and terrace. Talking about the functional organization , its ground floor was meant to host mixed use spaces.Thre  main areas along the Boulevard Mussolini , treated like duplexes with specific staircases connecting to the first floor and  the technical  spaces underground. The other part of the ground floor plan was reserved for  an apartment  that communicated also to the inner garden. Meanwhile all the first floor has a residential use therefore represents a more intimate space. Its structural system is a compound one with  perimetral massive walls of 30-45cm and inner reinforced concrete beam-column system.From 1945 until 1992 it served as a Kindergraden  and after 1992 the original owners got it back.",

It was connected to the square, the University building and the Colonnade strategiclly, visually and functionally.  To make it possible for the massive crowds  to come in and out of it a second square was created, smaller than the main square.It used to have the same façade material as the University, massive stone tiles.In the 1970s, the government decided to increase the capacity of the stadium and so the stairs were built with a system of reinforced concrete trusses.

It possesses a space of around 32 rooms, all decorated in oriental style. It represents a very important architectural complex constructed with massive bearing walls made out of qerpic and antisismic wooden wall beams, that give to it the feeling of a fortification or fortress. This being a type of  building and construction technique spread in Albania during the second half of the 19th century, during the feudal order. It’s a two storey building, listed as a  Monument of Culture, built with traditional techniques from old masters from Diber. It has special values not only for thenner functional organization but also for its architectural treatment and decorations. It's exterior is treated with simplicity, plain and clear volumetry with a white facade and some wooden decorative windows. It has an abundant garden space in front, with a well and the entire complex is surrounded by high walls with a principle gate. During A.Zogu's regime it was used as The National Library and further on during Communism it served as the officies of the Institute of Monuments and Culture (it is believed around 1963).  Its ownership returned back to its original owners and for awhile was used as a Bar/restaurant, despite this today stands not functional and non-accessible to the public.",

It has a symmetrical composition that is very visible, in its main volume and facade. The central unit of the villa has been treated in the form of a balustrade lodge and a perimeter column system. Some deforming interventions into the facade of the villa are evident, showing attempts to close even more the lodges with brick masonry, or through windows-blockings. No intervention was made for its restoration, as large plaster fragments and pieces have been detached from the original facade. Also the floor space was fragmented through the years, through a main division on the ground floor with a massive wall.",

        "description": "The Villa was commissioned by Dine Hoxha around 1931, a merchant from Dibra and an important figure at the time. It is located along 'Sotir Peci' street perpendicular to 'Durres' street and from the urban point of view, its somehow hidden, because of the residential building height, between the villa and the main street, that was built in 1959. Therefore it can be considered as a 'hidden treasure' of the area. During Communism, the Hoxha family was taken out of the villa to another house close-by, in the same neighborhood. Later on, the original owners moved back to the villa but because of their poor economic condition, they weren't able to look after the villa or restore it. Through the years Dine Hoxha's nephew has been living in a nearby house, leaving the villa to the families in need as it still is today. The villa is organized on three floors, one underground and two visible. Its main entrance is located in the north-east area and it's obvious by the use of the monumental, double ramp staircase, which forms in between a green patio, where a taller tree than the altimetry of the villa, is located. The south-eastern part of the house represents the first break in its volume, as it undergoes a visible retraction in the shape of a 'porch' with a double column system, located on the first floor. Another characteristic for its volumetry is the presence of a six-angled prism volume element, which rises in the northwestern part of the villa and on the first floor with the same column system, holding a roof with arched tiles. All the facades of the villa have been treated with many neo-classical ornaments and details that include window frames, doors, floors partitioning or wall corners. Its condition today shows a continuous lack of treatment, facing massive plaster-stripping of the façades and the exterior of the brick walls left visible. The main staircase part of it has been re-created, with concrete blocks which are far from being the material used in the original construction technique of the house.",

        "description": "The idea of the plan to realize ‘Kombinati Stalin’ of textiles, came up in the second meeting of the Congress of PPSH (Albanian Labour Party) where it was decided that Albania would develop as an agricultural and industrial country. The plan had a clear view of organizing the industrial areas in the closer suburbs, so that it won't be a big distance from the city center, therefor they could have under control the cost for proper transportations. Their location in the suburbs, was meant in case of further expansion of these areas. 'Kombinati Stalin’ of textiles was built with the help (economical and expertise) of the Soviet Union, it occupied an area of 25ha at the ‘Yzberisht’ valley, around 5km away from the city center. Albania was under a totalitarian regime and the concept of the city back then, was that of a ‘static’ one with separated areas with specific functions each, therefore the intent was to create a small city in 'Kombinat' with a working area, residential area (for workers), recreational area so that they wouldn’t need to move to the city center, but all their life would be organized in that micro-unit city. It was built around 1948 and the production started around 1951. During that time, it was one of the biggest industrial areas in Albania. The number of the people employed there until 1953, was 2200 and the intent was to increase that number to 4500, by 1955. 'Kombinati' had also its own powerhouse.",

Meanwhile, in 1924 the officers built the 'Officers' Club' in the location that today is The Puppet Theater. Due to the inability to realize a new building for the Parliament, the 'Officers Club' was adapted as the 'Parliament Building' until fascist Italy occupied Albania in 1939. In 1930, the building was reconstructed, several changes were made, the dome in the center of the roof was removed and other roof tiles of the time the 'marseille' tile units, were placed and the 'ethernite' layer removed. From this reconstruction, it changed much from the original appearance, returning to a more common building. While it represented a very special building as the first building of administrative character built in Tirana, at that time and due to a slightly different architecture from the dominant one, it had a more Germanic style(austro-hungarian). In 1939 it was taken over by the fascists and transformed into the 'The House of Fascio'. Later from 1950-1957 it was used as the Cultural Center 'Club of the Soviets'. in 1960-1961 it was adapted as a Puppet Theater, a function it still holds today. From 1996-2000, it started to be used for children's entertainment as well as the headquarters of the City Council but did not continue after 2000, after the City Hall provided a specific addition building for the City Council meetings. Several restoration projects have been carried out for the building, but have not been applied and the building has been alienated for years by interventions. ",

Mirash Ivanaj as the younger brother held the position of the Minister of Education around 1933-1935 and on the other hand Martin was a very important lawyer and judge. The two of them  together created the biggest private library with the biggest amount of books, that is still preserved today in the Building that today  hosts the’ Ivanaj Institute ‘, but once used to be the residence Villa of the Ivanaj family. The Villa was built around 1939 during the Italian occupation and at that time wasn’t completely finished, it consisted of 14 rooms. Afterwards the Villa was confiscated by the Italian Military forces  and during the years several additional units of different functions were added to the Villa’s site. Drita Ivanaj (daughter of Martin),  therefore legal owner of the Ivanaj properties in Tirana, was finally able to take physical possession of her ex-residence and land in this capital city on June 5th, 2009.  She had obtained title to this legacy in 1995, but could not access or use it until the military unit that occupied it for decades, free of charge. Today instead of this Villa there’s a  mixed-use building where on the main ground floors , ‘The Ivanaj Institute of Albania’ organizes its everyday activities.",
